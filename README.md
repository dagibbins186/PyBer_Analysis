# Overview of Analysis
Pyber Ride Share Company requested an analysis of its operations in urban, suburban and rural areas. 
\
\
# Results
**Number of Riders by City Type**
\
Among the city types (urban, suburban, rural), urban cities had the most riders. On average, about 24 riders partook in urban rideshares. Between 25% to 75% of all riders, fell in the range of 21-28 riders.

\
Contrarily, rural cities had the least riders. On average, about 6 riders called Pyber for services. Nine riders represented up to 75% of all riders. This means the urban market was about 3x larger in urban areas than rural areas. Pyber also attracted about 4x the number of riders, on average, in urban versus rural cities.
\
**Average Fares by Total Number of Riders**
\
The total number of rides per city was higher in urban areas than suburban and rural areas. However, the average fare was also lower among urban rides. Rural areas charged the most. In rural areas, the average fare was $34.62 versus $24.62. Suburban fares were $30.97 on average.

\
The suburban market also showed promise because 75% of rides charged fares up to $39.83. In urban markets, 75% of rides were under $34.48. There were also nearly double the number of drivers providing these rides in urban than suburban areas; 52 drivers versus 21 drivers respectfully. Since PyBer charged more, paid half the number of drivers, and met a steady demand for drives: the suburban market appeared quite profitable.
\
**Percent of Total Fares by City Type**
\
Despite lower average fares, the urban cities raised 62.7% of all fares.

\
Rural areas produced a fraction of the fares (6.8%). Pyber earned higher, average fares in rural areas, but it constituted a small proportion of total fares. Urban and suburban fares drove Pyber's business.
\
**Percent of Total Drivers by City Type**
\
Urban cities generated nearly 2/3 of Pyber's fares, and employed 81% of its drivers. It is possible that more fares came in because there were more drivers to provide rides. 
\

\
There is an inverse relationship between the price of fares and the quantity of rides. Since urban areas had more drivers, more rides were available. The quantity of drivers supported lower fares in urban areas.
\
**Total Fares by City Type Over Time**
\
Consistently, rural cities had the least total fares and urban cities the most total fares. Across city types, total fares followed similar patterns across months. 
\

\
For example, all cities saw a major dip in total fares during the month of April. Fares were also consistently highest in February.
