# Overview of Analysis
Pyber Ride Share Company requested an analysis of its operations in urban, suburban and rural areas. 


# Results
**Number of Riders by City Type**
\
Among the city types (urban, suburban, rural), urban cities had the most riders. On average, about 24 riders partook in urban rideshares. Between 25% to 75% of all riders, fell in the range of 21-28 riders.

\
Contrarily, rural cities had the least riders. On average, about 6 riders called Pyber for services. Nine riders represented up to 75% of all riders. This meant the urban market was about 3x larger in urban areas than rural areas. Pyber also attracted about 4x the average number of riders in urban versus rural cities.
\
\
**Average Fares by Total Number of Riders**
\
The total number of rides per city was higher in urban areas than suburban and rural areas. Correspondingly, urban rides raised the least, average fare ($24.62). Rural areas earned the most, average fare ($34.62). Suburban, average fares were in the middle ( $30.97).

\
The suburban market showed some promise because 75% of rides charged fares up to $39.83. In urban markets, 75% of rides were under $34.48. There were also nearly double the number of drivers providing these rides in the urban cities than suburban cities (52 drivers versus 21 drivers respectfully). In the suburbs, PyBer charged more, paid half the number of drivers, and met a steady demand for rides; relative to urban cities.
\
\
**Percent of Total Fares by City Type**
\
Despite lower average fares, the urban cities raised 62.7% of all fares. 
\

\
Rural areas produced a fraction of the fares (6.8%). Pyber earned higher, average fares in rural areas, but it constituted a small proportion of total fares. Urban and suburban fares drove Pyber's business.
\
\
**Percent of Total Drivers by City Type**
\
Urban cities generated nearly 2/3 of Pyber's fares, and employed 81% of its drivers. It is possible that more fares came in because more drivers were available to provide rides. 
\

\
An inverse relationship existed between the price of fares and the quantity of rides. The quantity of drivers supported lower fares in urban areas.
\
\
**Total Fares by City Type Over Time**
\
Consistently, rural cities had the least total fares and urban cities the most total fares. Across city types, total fares followed similar patterns across months. 
\

\
For example, all cities saw a major dip in total fares during the month of April. February consistly yieled the highest total fares among all months.
\

# Summary
There were more riders in urban areas and suburban cities areas than rural areas. The average fare was also lower in urban cities than suburban and rural cities. An inverse relationship appeared between quantity and price. Given 81% of drivers worked in the urban areas, it seemed slightly disproportional for only 64% of fares to come from urban areas. This might suggest the area is over-saturated. Nevertheless, the urban cities remained the highest grossing city type-no matter the month or time of year. More analysis of profitablity, should consider driver costs relative to total fares/revenue.
